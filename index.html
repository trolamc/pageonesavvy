<h2>PAGE ONE<strong> <em>SAVVY</em></strong></h2>
<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Your Global Internet Marketing Superstore</h4>
<p>Hello and welcome.</p>
<p>Chances are that you found this site based on a personal referral from one of our happy clients.</p>
<p>Without further ado...</p>
<p>Eleven years, seven months and a few days ago, (date updated bi-annually) ranking a personal website on the first page of Google, <strong>organically</strong>, came to pass with a hard fought, and won, learning curve.</p>
<p>Three months later, with four of the top ten organic rankings in that niche, the fascination with SEO, Page Optimization, Content, SEM, Website Building, Branding, Marketing, Call Tracking, Response Times, et al., became an obsession, and the vision of a business consulting business, (is that redundant... or a premium optimization?) was born.</p>
<h3><strong>Your turn</strong></h3>
<p>If you need more juice from your squeeze, if you need more calls, more accountability for your marketing dollars, more leads, more interaction on your website, mobile and tablet friendly ecosystems where a web presence seamlessly integrates across all platforms and devices, if you need more ROI then you need Page One Savvy.</p>
<h3>Premium Players</h3>
<p>We do what we do because we love to do it.</p>
<p>(Does that remind you of To be is to do. To do is to be. Do be do be do...? I'm just riffing, Jazz baby.)</p>
<p>We are not a flavor for everyone, we look for the best of the best to work with, or those that want to be the best. &nbsp;What we're sayin' is that this isn't a charity. We're looking for good people and companies that want to dominate niches.</p>
<h3><strong>Us</strong></h3>
<p>Our mission is results, i.e. yours. &nbsp;Building your business with a page one internet presence.</p>
<p>Business Culture as Fashion?</p>
<p>We've done the whole Brooks Bros. thing, flirted with Brioni, and yeah, can rock the two button tropical weight cashmere when the mood strikes.</p>
<p>Lately, there's been a cruise toward a salt air sniffing, flip flops and board shorts vibe. &nbsp;We consider it more of a holiday and weekend posture because when the down and dirty of the guts and glory of getting you page one results are on the line, we're purely short sleeve oxford button down, pocket protector and horn rims.</p>
<p>Ya feelin' me?</p>
<h3><strong>Next Step</strong></h3>
<p>Are you that player, ready to step up? Asking because our best certainly isn't free, and low budget we're not.</p>
<p>If ROI is something you can dig, then dig us. 'Cause we want to fatten your wallet and create a long term relationship that vaults your sales into the stratosphere. Hyperbole aside, page one organic results are where the duckets get collected.... and we've got your ticket station.</p>
<p>Give us a jingle.</p>
<p>Use the celly from the biz card or call this sideline.</p>
