<h2>Welcome to Page One Savvy - Your Internet Marketing Superstore</h2>
<p>Around Eleven years, seven months and a few days ago, ranking my personal website on the first page of Google, organically, came to pass with a hard fought learning curve. Four of the top ten organic rankings later, the fascination with SEO, page optimization, content, SEM, website building, branding, marketing, call tracking, response times, et al., became an obsession, and the vision of a business consulting businesss, (is that redundant... or a premium optimization?) was born.</p>
<p>Your turn.</p>
<p>If you need more juice from your squeeze, if you need more calls, more accountability for your marketing dollars, more leads, more interaction on your website, mobile and tablet friendly ecosystems where a web presence seamlessly integrates across all platforms and devices, you need Page One Savvy.</p>

<p>We do what we do because we love to do it. (Does that remind you of To be is to do. To do is to be. Do be do be do... ? I'm just riffing, Jazz baby.) Because we aren't a flavor for everyone, we are looking for the best of the best to work with, or those that want to be the best. What we're sayin' is that this isn't a charity. We've gone global and we are looking for a few good peeps that want to dominate some niches. We've done the whole Brooks Bros. thing, and yeah, can rock the two button tropical weight when the mood strikes. Equally, there's the cruise toward salt air flip flop vibe we cultivate, more of an affectation because the down and dirty of the guts of getting results is purely short sleeve button down, pocket protector bifocals. Ya feelin' me?</p>
<p>Are you that player, ready to step up? Asking because our best certainly isn't free, and low budget we're not. If ROI is something you can dig, then dig us. 'Cause we want to fatten your wallet and create a long term relationship that vaults your sales to the statosphere. Hyperbole be damned, page one organics are where the duckets get collected.... and we've got the plan to get you there.</p>
<p>Give us a jingle.</p>
