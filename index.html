<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Without further ado...</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Eleven years, seven months and a few days ago, (date updated bi-annually) ranking a personal website</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">on the first page of Google, <strong>organically</strong>, came to pass with a hard fought, and won, learning curve.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;">Three months later, with four of the top ten organic rankings in that niche, the fascination with SEO,Page Optimization, Content, SEM, Website Building, Branding, Marketing, Call Tracking, Response Times, et al., became an obsession, and the vision of a business consulting businesss, (is that redundant... or a premium optimization?) was born.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We do what we do because we love to do it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(Does that remind you of To be is to do. To do is to be. Do be do be do... ? I'm just riffing, Jazz baby.)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We are not a flavor for everyone, we look for the best of the best to work with, or those that want to be the best.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">What we're sayin' is that this isn't a charity. We've gone global and we are looking for good people and companies that want to dominate niches.</p>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Us</strong></h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Our mission is results, building your business with a page one internet presence.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We've done the whole Brooks Bros. thing, and yeah, can rock the two button tropical weight cashmere when the mood strikes.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Lately, there's been a cruise toward a sniffing salt air flip flops and board shorts vibe.&nbsp; More of a holiday and weekend posture because when the down and dirty of the guts and glory of getting you results is on the line, we're purely short sleeve oxford button down, pocket protector and horn rims.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Ya feelin' me?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Are you that player, ready to step up? Asking because our best certainly isn't free, and low budget we're not.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If ROI is something you can dig, then dig us. 'Cause we want to fatten your wallet and create a long term relationship that vaults your sales to the statosphere.</p>
